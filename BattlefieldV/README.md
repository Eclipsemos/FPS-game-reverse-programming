# Battlefield V
- Repo updated: 2024/5/22
## Anti-cheat
EA has deployed **EA-AC** on the Battlefield V this April just like the Battlefield 2042, may future on Battlefield One too. EA-AC was announced to be a EA self-developed Kernel level anti-cheats, which means the old hacks I put on this repo are useless since they were developed without any bypass functionality. Therefore, you need a kernel driver to proceed future reverse engineering development.
EA-AC does ban HWID, but I'd say its almost same as Easy Anti Cheat and most of paid spoofer works.
## Reverse Engineering
### Aimbot/ESP/Radar
Aimbot always come up with the ESP since the pipeline function works for both of them. DMA workds

### Rage
